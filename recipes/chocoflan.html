    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <h3>Cake:</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Non-stick Cooking Spray</li>
        <li>½ cup Smucker's Caramel Flavored Topping</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup Crisco Pure Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Flan:</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk </li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) can Pet Evaporated Milk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Preparation steps:</h3>
    <ol class="preparation" type="1">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 12-cup fluted tube pan with nonstick spray. Place a piece of rolled-up foil into the tube part of the pan to prevent cake from spilling over the top. Pour caramel topping into the prepared pan. </li>
        <li> Beat cake mix, water, 3 eggs, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl until well combined; pour evenly over caramel topping. </li>
        <li> Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, 4 eggs, cream cheese, and vanilla in a blender. Process until smooth; pour slowly over cake batter. While baking, the cake will rise and the milk mixture will go to the bottom. </li>
        <li> Coat a piece of foil with nonstick spray. Cover the pan tightly with foil, coated-side down. Place the pan in a large roasting pan. Pour hot water into the roasting pan to a depth of 2 inches. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs on it, about 2 hours. </li>
        <li> Place cake on a cooling rack; cool for 15 minutes. Remove foil and invert onto a serving plate. Cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Chill for 4 hours or overnight before serving. </li>
    </ol>
